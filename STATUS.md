# jet-cad — project status

**Last updated:** 2026-08-20
**Verified against:** `main` @ `3f92163`, `plan-3c` worktree @ `e5aa3c4`, working tree clean.
Every count below was produced by running the suite, not by reading a report.

---

## TL;DR — where you left off

Plan 3c (**text**) is 13 tasks into 15, running on the `plan-3c` worktree.
Tasks 0–12 are committed. **Everything is green and the tree is clean.**

| Suite | State |
|---|---|
| `packages/jet_cad_2d` — engine | **717 tests, all pass**, analyze/format clean |
| `packages/jet_cad_2d_flutter` — widgets | **152 tests, all pass** (1 pre-existing skip), analyze/format clean |
| `flutter test --tags golden` | **13 pass**; no pre-existing PNG regenerated |
| `apps/dev_harness_2d` | analyze/format clean; **R2/R4a/R4b run on macOS in profile mode** |

**The gate's feasibility number is taken and the news is good:** 18 distinct
paragraph-cache keys at the working-set camera against a limit of 512, and
**zero new layouts in the steady-state frame on real hardware**.
`kParagraphCacheLimit` does not move, and all three device rigs agree.

**Next up is Task 13 — the mutation log.** See [Resume here](#resume-here).

## What this project is

A CAD workspace holding **two independent product lines that share a name and
nothing else**.

### `jet_cad_2d` — the live line (pure Dart 2D CAD)

A pure-Dart 2D CAD engine and document model. **No OCCT, no FFI, no native
build, no Flutter dependency** — it runs anywhere Dart runs. Rendering and
widgets live in the separate `jet_cad_2d_flutter` package so the engine stays
free of `dart:ui`. This is where all current work happens.

### `jet_cad` — the dormant line (OCCT 3D)

A Flutter CAD package backed by Open CASCADE Technology over FFI, with a macOS
viewport. Plans 1 and 2 for it shipped; **Plan 3 (the interactive OCCT viewport)
was written as a kickoff but never executed** — the project pivoted to the
pure-Dart 2D line instead. Last commit touching it: `139a677`, 2026-07-13.
Nothing here is being worked on. Do not assume its docs describe current
direction.

`jet_cad_2d` is Dart-only (`meta`, `vector_math`; dev: `test`, `vm_service`).
`jet_cad_2d_flutter` depends on Flutter + `jet_cad_2d` by path. Both are
`resolution: workspace` members of the root pubspec.

## Completed work

### Plan 1 — the 2D core (merged)

Identity and handles, the scene tree, columnar geometry and entity stores,
components, commands with undo, style tables and resolution, the packed R-tree
spatial index with a dirty overlay, snapping, and a deterministic versioned JSON
document format.

### Plan 2 — the backlog (merged)

Query performance and the zero-allocation invariant on the pick and snap paths.
Its `query_allocation_test.dart` harness is now a standing gate that every later
plan must not break.

> **Known carried failure:** `dart run benchmark/query_throughput.dart` has one
> failing row, `snap at dirty threshold`, carried forward from Plan 2. It is
> expected. Do not treat it as a new regression.

### Plan 3a — the render foundation (merged)

The first working render path: camera, coordinate rebasing, the `DrawSink`
paint seam, `DraftPainter`, the reference walk, and the differential oracle that
checks the painter against an independent implementation.

### Plan 3b — batching and dashes (merged)

**Batching was measured and refuted, not shipped.** The spike found the most
call-collapsed mode was **2.7× slower to rasterise** than one
`save`/`transform`/`restore` triple per leaf, and the plan's own pre-declared
stop clause fired. What shipped instead:

- The cull floor and the style memo were **deleted** — both were measured losses.
- Every line-like leaf is carried into screen space unconditionally, replacing
  the old anisotropy-gated bypass.
- An engine-side **dasher**: screen space for polylines, arc-window-aware for
  circles and arcs, with a human-reviewed collapse floor (`kDashCollapsePx`).

The profiling task also answered the standing question about an unexplained
179 ms: it is **leaf-count-bound GPU vertex work**, not fragment fill and not
draw-call dispatch. That finding is what makes a picture cache (Plan 3e)
worth building.

> **Every `flutter drive` number in the 3b results note is contaminated:**
> macOS Low Power Mode was on system-wide for the whole session and could not be
> turned off. CPU-only paths are unaffected; build and raster columns at 500k
> entities are elevated 4–12×. **Any future `flutter drive` note must state
> whether Low Power Mode was on.**

## In flight: Plan 3c — text

- **Spec (binding):** [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-17-jet-cad-2d-plan-3c-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-17-jet-cad-2d-plan-3c-design.md)
- **Plan:** [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-jet-cad-2d-plan-3c-text.md](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-jet-cad-2d-plan-3c-text.md)
- **Ledger (the only progress record — read it):** `.claude/worktrees/plan-3c/.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-17-jet-cad-2d-plan-3c-text/progress.md`

**Goal:** store, measure, hit-test and draw single-line text so the product's
real payload — table numbers and room labels — renders, and measure what it
costs.

**The central design idea:** every paragraph is laid out **once at a nominal em
size** (`kNominalTextPixels = 100.0`) and every text attribute — height,
rotation, width factor, oblique angle, justification — becomes a **transform**.
So the paragraph cache key carries no height, angle or width factor. It is
`(string, textStyle handle, ResolvedStyle.argb)` — argb is in the key because
`ui.Paragraph` bakes its colour and `drawParagraph` takes no `Paint`.

`kCapHeightRatio = 0.7`: DXF height is cap height, so the matrix scale is
`effectiveHeight / metrics.capHeight`.

**Out of scope for 3c:** MTEXT, DXF 72=3/72=5 layout, text LOD, fills, picture cache.

### Task board

| # | Task | State |

| 4 | `entityBounds` and all four call sites | ✅ complete, fix round 1/5 |
| 5 | `SetEntityTextCommand` | ✅ complete (landed with T4 per Ruling 11) |
| 6 | Text picks as `HitKind.fill` | ✅ complete, approved |
| 7 | The corpus grows two text sources | ✅ complete, fix round 1/5 |
| 8 | The sink learns one text op | ✅ complete, approved |
| 9 | `FlutterTextMeasurer` + paragraph cache | ✅ complete (Rulings 21–23; one real defect found) |
| 10 | The painter draws text | ⬜ **NEXT** |

| 12 | Rigs, counters, the number the gate depends on | ⬜ not started |
| 13 | Mutation testing | ⬜ not started |
| 14 | Exit gate and the results note | ⬜ not started |

Test count grew 667 → 716 engine and 123 → 133 widget across Tasks 0–9.

## Resume here

Task 12 is committed at `e5aa3c4`. **Task 13 — the mutation log** is next.

### What Task 12 measured, and what it means for the gate

| camera | distinct `(string, style, argb)` keys | vs limit 512 | steady-state frame |
|---|---|---|---|
| working set | **18** | under, by 28x | newLayouts 0, newEvictions 0 |
| whole drawing | **4140** | 8x over | newLayouts 4140, newEvictions 4140 |

**`kParagraphCacheLimit` stays at 512 and Ruling 4's one permitted raise is
unspent.** The row is specified against the working-set camera; the
whole-drawing camera is the one the rig itself calls "not a frame anyone
renders". Confirmed on real hardware: `flutter drive --profile -d macos` with
`TEXT=true` reports **newLayouts 0** in the forced steady-state frame of all
three rigs — R2 (23 text ops), R4a (18) and R4b (18).

The row is also **weak** — 18 of 512 would stay green at a limit of 32. The rig
prints a key-pressure ladder so Task 14 can state the margin rather than assert
it: the limit starts binding between **12000 and 24000 world units wide**,
about five times the working-set camera.

### What Task 13 must do

Run the spec's sixteen mutants one at a time: edit the named expression, run
the narrowest suite that should catch it, record which test failed and how,
then restore the file and confirm `git status --short` is empty before the
next. Write `docs/superpowers/notes/plan-3c-mutation-log.md` in the same shape
as `plan-3b-mutation-log.md` — mutant, expression, suite, killing test, and a
"Reproducing" section naming the exact commands.

**Do not `git checkout` to revert a mutation.** Copy the file aside first and
restore from the copy in a `finally` block; Task 10 lost a full task's
uncommitted work to `git checkout`.

Three of the sixteen deserve care, and two of them are already covered:

- **Lay the paragraph out at the effective em size instead of nominal.** Renders
  correctly. Only the zero-layout row and the cache-entry count can see it — if
  nothing fails, add the assertion that makes it fail before moving on. **Not
  yet covered.**
- **Allocate a fresh `TextMetrics` on a cache hit** — `query_allocation_test`.
- **Drop `argb` from the cache key** — covered twice now, by
  `flutter_text_measurer_test` and visibly by golden rung 1.

Tasks 9–12 already ran 33 mutants of their own; the ledger's tables are the
record and Task 13's log should cite them rather than re-run them.

### Then Task 14

Exit gate + results note, then `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`.

**Task 14 inherits three debts.**

1. **Nothing outside the tests wires a real measurer into a document**
   (Ruling 42). `DraftDocument.empty` defaults to `InsertionPointMeasurer`, the
   zero metrics, so `composeTransform`'s `height / capHeight` divides into zero
   — singular text transform, glyph boxes collapsed to points. An application
   built the ordinary way draws no text **and reports no error**. This is a real
   defect with no owner yet.
2. **There are two paragraph caches, not one** (Ruling 41). The painter takes
   metrics from `document.textMeasurer`; the sink lays paragraphs out through
   `DraftCanvas`'s own. Text costs up to two layouts per leaf, and the
   query-only row pays for text even though `NullDrawSink` lays nothing out —
   measured at **+97 ms** at the whole-drawing camera.
3. **The allocation gate measures the engine helpers, not the painter.**
   `text_paint_allocation_test.dart` lives in the engine suite because
   `jet_cad_2d_flutter` has no `vm_service` dependency, so it calls the engine
   helpers in the painter's order rather than calling the painter. A painter
   that went back through the allocating wrappers would not turn it red.
   Closing it means moving `AllocationMeter` into `jet_cad_2d/lib/src/testing/`.

---

## Rulings that still bind the remaining tasks

The ledger carries 47 numbered rulings. These are the ones that constrain work
you have not done yet:

**Ruling 4 — the cache limit is not a tuning knob.** `kParagraphCacheLimit` is
owned by Task 9 and may be raised **once**, in Task 12, and only with the
measured distinct-visible-key count recorded beside it. Lowering
`attributedInstanceFraction` is equally acceptable. **Relaxing the
zero-new-layouts gate row is not.** Otherwise the gate passes because the corpus
was thinned rather than because the cache works.

**Ruling 20 — discharged in Task 10, with numbers.** The residual-path norm is
**1.00** allocations per leaf (one `Transform2`). A text leaf through
`resolveTextAttributes` + `textLocalTransform` was **9.00**; through one
long-lived `TextLayout` it is **0.87–1.00**, at or below the norm. The spec's
second `Float64List(16)` was not the fix — under the plan's shape the sink
composes nothing — the reusable layout was, and `TextLayout` lost `@internal`
for it. Gate:
`packages/jet_cad_2d/test/invariants/text_paint_allocation_test.dart`. Every
assertion there is a **ratio**, because the profiler was observed once to read
0.07 where two other runs read 1.00.

**Ruling 10 — `boxOfLeaf` returns null after an edit, correctly.** Dirtying a
leaf removes it from the packed R-tree and parks it in the overlay. Any test
reading a box after an edit must use the codebase idiom:
`index.boxOfLeaf(slot) ?? index.dirty.boxOf(slot)`.

**Ruling 12 — never `tables.textStyles[...]!`.** `JsonCodec._loadTables` clears
the seeded defaults and `TableSection.remove` is public, so a document missing
handle 5 crashes on plain `doc.extents`. Use
`DraftDocument.textStyleOf(Handle)`, which falls back to a `const
TextStyleRecord`.

**Ruling 22 — pin the layout em size exactly, not positively.** The measurer's
one unforgivable failure is laying a paragraph out at anything other than
`kNominalTextPixels`, and `expect(ascent, greaterThan(0))` is satisfied by every
positive em size. `flutter_test`'s font is exactly 0.75em ascent / 0.25em
descent / 1em per character, so the assertions are exact: `WC` at nominal is
ascent 75.0, descent 25.0, advance 200.0. A Flutter upgrade that moves the test
font fails loudly, which this plan prefers to a silent pass.

**Ruling 23 — the two measurers must agree, and one guard is still owed.**
`Paragraph.longestLine` is `-FLT_MAX` for a paragraph with no lines, and
`-FLT_MAX` is **finite**, so no `isFinite` guard catches it.
`FlutterTextMeasurer` now shares `ascent`/`descent`'s `lines.isEmpty` guard for
`advanceWidth` so it returns `0.0`, matching `MetricModelMeasurer`. The seam's
premise — and the differential oracle's validity — is that the two are
interchangeable. The draw-path `isEmpty` guard landed in Task 10, in the
painter *and* in the reference walk, and both halves are pinned by mutation.

**Ruling 28 — the paragraph flip lives in the sink, not the painter.**
`Canvas.drawParagraph` draws y-down from the top of the line; the residual maps
glyph space, y-up from the baseline. `CanvasDrawSink.text` reconciles them with
`translate(0, alphabeticBaseline)` then `scale(1, -1)`. It must **not** move
into the painter: it is a `dart:ui` fact, and `reference_walk` composes the
same residual independently — sharing it would have the oracle share the
assumption it exists to test.

**Ruling 33 — the fixture set, not any one task, is the recurring hole.** Three
Task 10 mutations survived a green suite, all degenerate fixtures: no blank
text entity anywhere (the corpus *replaces* blanks with labels rather than
adding them), and **no text entity on a non-STANDARD style anywhere**, which is
Ruling 13's exact hole reopening one plan later in two new call sites. Both are
now covered by hand-built fixtures. Any new text call site must be checked
against both before it is called done.

**Ruling 39/40 — the cache limit is settled, with a measured margin.** 18 keys
at the working-set camera against 512; the limit does not move and Ruling 4's
one permitted raise is unspent. The margin is the key-pressure ladder, not a
feeling: binding starts around 12000–24000 world units wide.

**Ruling 44 — measurement machinery fails by printing a plausible number.**
Three of Task 12's mutants survived a green suite, and none of the three would
have errored: a dropped `DraftCanvas.drawText` forward prints a text-off row
identical to text-on; a `resetCounters` that also cleared the cache prints one
new layout per visible string and makes a working cache read as a failing gate;
a `TextKeySink` without the colour axis under-reports the gate's own number.
Any new counter, flag or rig sink needs a test that a *wrong reading* would
fail, not just one that a crash would.

**Ruling 34 — Plan 3c Task 11 Step 2's rung-4 criterion is backwards, and the
engine wins.** The step says to check that the crossed cells are "wider at the
same slope rather than more slanted". `composeTransform` shears *before* the
width-factor x-scale — `w * (x + k*y)`, which `textLocalTransform`'s doc names
as the DXF reading and `text_geometry_test.dart` pins as
`c = widthFactor * tan(oblique) * scale`. The stem slope is therefore
`widthFactor * tan(oblique)` and the wide cell **is** more slanted; the plan's
sentence describes the swapped order, which is the drawing rung 4 exists to
reject. If any later task quotes that sentence, it is quoting the mutant.

**Ruling 37 — a colour golden needs a repeated string, not a palette.** See
[Resume here](#resume-here); it constrains Task 13's "visibly by a colour
golden" requirement to a property of the fixture.

**Ruling 36 — a golden document must carry a real measurer.** The painter
takes its scale from `document.textMeasurer` while the sink lays the paragraph
out through its own; the glyphs sit inside the box the document believes they
occupy only while the two agree. A golden on `MetricModelMeasurer` pins a
drawing no production wiring produces — the degenerate fixture in its most
expensive form, a *reviewed* one.

**Ruling 17 — the corpus must hold exactly 20 distinct labels.**
`expect(labels.length, 20)`, not `lessThanOrEqualTo(20)`. The distribution is
the exact property Task 12's distinct-key measurement is taken against; a
degenerate assertion collapsing it to one label would silently void the gate.

## Plan 3c exit gate (Task 14)

### Checks

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| engine suite | `cd packages/jet_cad_2d && dart test` |
| engine analyze/format | `dart analyze && dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .` |
| widget suite | `cd packages/jet_cad_2d_flutter && flutter test` |
| goldens | `flutter test --tags golden` — all pass, **no existing PNG regenerated** |
| widget analyze/format | `flutter analyze && dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .` |
| harness analyze | `cd apps/dev_harness_2d && flutter analyze` |
| allocation harness | `dart test test/invariants/query_allocation_test.dart` — zero allocation **with text in the corpus** |
| query throughput | `dart run benchmark/query_throughput.dart` — `snap at dirty threshold` is the known carried failure |
| rigs | `flutter test --tags rig --run-skipped`, then `flutter drive --profile -d macos` |

### Failable criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|---|---|
| repeat frame at the working-set camera | **zero** new paragraph layouts |
| evictions per repeat frame, working-set camera | **zero** |
| peak live paragraphs | ≤ the declared limit |
| `skippedTextCount` on `textRigCorpus` | **0** |
| differential and non-vacuity, text on | pass |
| reference-query differential, text picking | pass |
| overlay-equals-rebuild for an edited text | pass |
| mutation log | every mutant killed or argued equivalent |

**If a failable row misses: record it and stop.** Plan 3b's Task 4 stop clause
is the precedent — a row that fires is a result. Write the number, say what it
implies for 3d and 3e, and stop rather than tuning until it complies.

The results note must state **whether macOS Low Power Mode was on**.

---

## Roadmap after 3c

### Plan 3d — fills

**It inherits no mechanism from 3b.** The 3b design's "flush contract" — a fill
flushing open draw buckets — has nothing to attach to, because batching was
reverted. 3d gets the ordinary one-call-per-primitive `CanvasDrawSink`.

**The open problem:** draw order is ascending handle value, so a region's fill
must carry a **lower** handle than its boundary or it paints over its own
outline. But handles are monotonic by creation and the natural authoring order
is *draw the boundary, then hatch it* — which produces exactly the failing case.
3d must choose and state one of:

- give the fill an explicit draw-order key the painter honours ahead of handle order, or
- require the region command to create boundary and fill in one transaction with the ordering reserved.

### Plan 3e — the definition/tile picture cache

The prize is real: the dominant cost is leaf-count-bound GPU vertex work, and
dashing makes that story **stronger** — one dashed polyline becomes dozens of
drawn spans per leaf without moving the painter's op count.

Four traps recorded in
[docs/superpowers/notes/2026-08-17-carry-forward-additions.md](docs/superpowers/notes/2026-08-17-carry-forward-additions.md):

1. **`documentRevision` does not exist yet** and nothing says what bumps it. If
   an ordinary entity edit bumps it, every definition picture is discarded every
   command — the exact pathology the two-channel split exists to avoid, and the
   planned gate row would not catch it.
2. **Tile invalidation has a hole for edits inside a definition.** A touched
   handle owned by a definition appears in no tile's handle list and its new box
   is in definition-local space. Tiles must record which definitions they baked
   and map touched handles through placements.
3. **A cached picture is no longer scale-invariant now that dashes exist.** Dash
   phase and the collapse floor are both functions of screen-space scale, so
   zoom far enough and baked-dashed entities need to render solid. That is a new
   invalidation axis with no name yet.
4. **`InstanceNode` carries only 2 of `StyleContext`'s 6 fields.**
   `linetype`, `linetypeScale`, `lineweight`, `transparency` are missing, and
   DXF's INSERT carries all four. `StyleContext` is the picture cache key, so
   this model decision belongs **before** the cache, not after.

**Do not design 3e against a fixed op-count ceiling.** The web whole-drawing
abort is reproducible but its trigger is unknown — a memory- or
session-dependent CanvasKit failure explains it with no code at fault. What 3e
is owed first is a back-to-back, same-session re-run.

## Traps

- **`flutter pub get` rewrites three `analysis_options.yaml` files** in this
  workspace. They must **never** be committed. Check `git status` after any pub
  operation.
- **The degenerate fixture is the dominant defect class here.** Plan 3c alone
  shipped it three times: fixtures all at the identity transform, all at the
  origin, all with default attributes, all one distinct string. Every one was
  caught by mutation testing, none by reading. A test that cannot be made red by
  a named mutation is not evidence.
- **`query_allocation_test` is a standing gate, not a Plan 2 artifact.** A
  `measure()` that allocates on a cache *hit* breaks it. This already bit once:
  Task 2's record-tuple memo allocated 41.5 objects per pick-path call, found in
  Task 6.
- **Reviewers verify claims independently.** Synthesized test output invalidates
  a task.
- **Never `git checkout` a file to revert a mutation.** It restores HEAD, so it
  silently wipes every uncommitted change in that file — Task 10 lost a full
  task's painter work that way. Copy the file aside first and restore from the
  copy in a `finally` block.
- **`flutter_test` renders Ahem, not a real font,** unless one is loaded. Any
  golden asserting something about glyph *shape* — that a mirrored label reads
  backwards, most of all — needs `test/golden/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf` loaded
  through a `FontLoader`, or it asserts nothing while looking like it does.
- **`bool.fromEnvironment` accepts only `"true"` and `"false"`.**
  `--dart-define=TEXT=1` reads as **false**. One device rig run measured the
  wrong document and printed numbers that looked entirely correct; only the
  `corpus=on/off` line it now prints gave it away.
- **`flutter drive` rewrites
  `apps/dev_harness_2d/macos/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.** CocoaPods
  bumps `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` 10.15 → 12.0 in all three configurations.
  Same class as the `analysis_options.yaml` trap: revert it, do not commit it.
- **The `plan-3c` ledger is the only progress record** for that plan — TodoWrite
  was unavailable in the session that ran it. Keep appending to it.

---

## Housekeeping done 2026-08-20

Removed as dead weight:

- `.superpowers/sdd/` scratch for **finished** plans — Plan 1-core, Plan 3b, and
  the loose Plan 2 reports and `review-*.diff` files (~2.7 MB, git-ignored,
  **not recoverable**). Their conclusions live in `docs/superpowers/notes/`.
  The **`plan-3c` ledger was deliberately kept** — it is live state.
- Speckit scaffolding: `.specify/` and the nine `.claude/skills/speckit-*/`
  skills. Unreferenced anywhere in the project; the repo uses the superpowers
  SDD workflow instead. Tracked by git, so recoverable via
  `git checkout a7008a6 -- .specify .claude/skills`.
- `.superpowers/plan-3-kickoff-prompt.md` — the kickoff for the abandoned OCCT
  Plan 3 viewport, superseded by the 2D line.
- `CLAUDE.md` rewritten from its speckit stub into real project instructions.

**Known cost:** six links in three tracked docs
