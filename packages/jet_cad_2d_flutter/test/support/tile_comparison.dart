// Live frame against tiled frame, byte for byte.
//
// **Why not `measureAgreement`.** That instrument's vertices arm rasterises in
// Dart (`support/sink_comparison.dart`), so it never reaches a `Canvas` and
// never executes a `drawImageRect`. A tile is invisible to it.
//
// **Why zero rather than a tolerance.** `quantiseCamera` puts every tile
// destination on whole device pixels at every camera, so a blit is a 1:1
// texel-to-pixel copy and there is nothing for a tolerance to absorb. A
// tolerance here would hide exactly the defects the criteria exist to catch.
//
// **What this cannot prove.** Software Skia does not antialias `drawVertices`
// at all — `drawvertices_antialiasing_test.dart` pins that, in its own words
// as "a fact about `flutter_test`'s software Skia, not about this codebase" —
// so this instrument cannot produce an antialiased seam and a zero result here
// is partly a property of the instrument. It proves geometric completeness:
// no pixel missing, none drawn twice, no clipping arithmetic error. Accepted
// gap G1 owns the rest, and mutant M3 is deferred to it. **M15 is the mutant
// this instrument fires**, and it moves pixels software Skia renders perfectly
// well.
