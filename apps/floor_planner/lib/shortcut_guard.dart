/// **Why this exists.** A `Shortcuts` or `CallbackShortcuts` above a text
/// field takes the field's keystrokes ("Shortcuts prevent text input fields
/// from receiving their keystrokes as text input", Flutter's
/// `editable_text.dart`). The shell's tool letters and its cmd/ctrl+Z are
/// such shortcuts.
///
/// **What it does.** It maps each of them, **nearer** the field, to
/// `DoNothingAndStopPropagationTextIntent`. `EditableText` answers that
/// intent with `DoNothingAction(consumesKey: false)`, so the key stops here
/// and reaches the field as text.
///
/// **Elsewhere it is inert.** With focus anywhere other than a text field,
/// no action is found, and the key bubbles up to the shell as before.
